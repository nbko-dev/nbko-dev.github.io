I"<p><strong>Object-oriented programming</strong> (<strong>OOP</strong>) is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm">programming paradigm</a> based on the concept of â€œ<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(computer_science)">objects</a>â€, which can contain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data">data</a>, in the form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(computer_science)">fields</a> (often known as <em>attributes</em> or <em>properties</em>), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_(computer_science)">methods</a></em>). A feature of objects is an objectâ€™s procedures that can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated (objects have a notion of â€œ<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_(computer_programming)">this</a>â€ or â€œselfâ€). In OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another. OOP languages are diverse, but the most popular ones are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class-based_programming">class-based</a>, meaning that objects are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instance_(computer_science)">instances</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_science)">classes</a>, which also determine their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_type">types</a>.</p>
